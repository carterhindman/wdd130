      <h3>Pricing Information</h3>
      <p>
        Pricing Information can be found on this page. Pricing will be available for exterior windows, interior windows, and screens. As of now pricing will just be per window, but sometimes there will be deals on full packages.
        <br>
        As of now, this is the pricing information. <br><br>
        <b>Rough Pricing for windows (per window, not per pane)</b><br><br>
          Small Window - $2-$4 (eg. 24” x 36” or similar in size)<br>
          Medium/Average Sized Window - $4-8 (eg. 48” x 36”, 60” by 36” or similar sizes)<br>
          Large Window - $8-$10 (Anything bigger than previously mentioned)<br>
          Any windows above the first story will cost $3-$10 more depending on the size, and the difficulty reaching them<br>
          Hard water stains cost $1-$2<br>
          Screens - $2-$4 depending on the size<br>
          Interiors - usually around half the price of the exterior windows unless they are hard to get to<br><br>
          
          All pricing depends on the specific windows, where they are, and how hard it is to get to them. Keep in mind this is a rough pricing chart, but I will try my best to keep it affordable!<br>

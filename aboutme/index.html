    <h2>Carter</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Carter and I love everything about Computers. I am currently going into Software Development and I love it so far! I love programming, and building computers. I also love learning!</p>
    <p>I am a return missionary from the Jacksonville Florida Mission, and I just got married last month. My wife and I live in Utah, but are both doing school online through BYU Idaho, which has been great! Married life is awesome!</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life. The church means everything to me and I always love doing things in my life that invite the spirit. I know that if we build our foundations on Christ we will have great lives! (Helaman 5:12)</p>
